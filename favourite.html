            <p>Few bands have had careers quite like Metallica. They were arguably heavy metal’s first superstar band (“Oi!”, says someone from Iron Maiden; “Hang about!” adds a Black Sabbath member), and their career has been – at once – magnificent, hyper-creative, ridiculous, thrilling, heart-breaking, pioneering – and occasionally total dogshit.

                With more releases than we’ve got fingers, theirs is a discography that’s easy to lose yourself in. Here is, then, a rundown and reappraisal of all the metal titans’ releases, from thrashy beginnings to stadium rock triumph and beyond. No need to thank us. Don’t headbang too hard.

                First things first: Metallica’s ninth studio album isn’t a bad album. So why’s it listed here, so low in this rundown? Well, as we shall see, the San Francisco quartet have rarely ever played things safe. Their storied career is filled with epic highs – and hilarious misfires – but they’ve never ever been boring. And ‘Death Magnetic’? It’s merely a competent collection of songs.

                There is some new territory forged; produced by Rick Rubin, this is the first set of Metallica songs not to be laid down by Bob Rock since 1988’s ‘…And Justice For All’. It’s also the first-time bassist and former Suicidal Tendencies man Robert Trujillo appears on wax. It was warmly received at the time – after the creative floundering of 2003’s ‘St. Anger’ coherent songs were most welcome – but it’s not dishonest to say it’s just a bit dull.

                “We were gonna do them both as a double album,” says guitarist Kirt Hammett of ‘Reload’ and its sister album ‘Load’, released the previous year, “but we didn’t want to spend that long in the studio.” And so ‘Reload’ yapped at the heels of its excellent counterpart, containing a collection of songs, to quote singer James Hetfield, “consisting of all the crappy songs from the original session”.

                Hetfield does the album a disservice; the bluesy, lolloping ‘The Memory Remains’ (featuring an absolutely smashed Marianne Faithfull on vocals) is a great piece of work, while opener ‘Fuel’ was a much-loved staple of Metallica live sets as recently as early 2019. There is, however, much meandering later on, and little better than the contents of the superior ‘Load’.

                With hindsight, the writing was on the wall. Bassist Jason Newsted had left the group prior to entering the studio. Recording had already been pushed back a year as a result of James Hetfield’s treatment for alcoholism. And, with friction growing between Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich (a condition of the guitarist’s treatment was he must cease work in the studio at 4pm each day; Ulrich, perhaps insensitively, wasn’t ready to rework the culture of a group once nicknamed ‘Alcoholica’), the band made the bizarre decision to allow therapist Phil Towle into the live room.

Years later, Ulrich would claim Towle “saved the band”, but at the time it was unsettling to see (the entire process was documented by filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky’s seminal rock doc Some Kind Of Monster) an outsider meddling with the fractured dynamic of a band whose unity had long seen them through. The music made during this time has long been derided – there are few guitar solos, while Ulrich’s drums sound like they’ve been recorded in a swamp – but there’s nothing about this era that isn’t uninteresting. And here’s the truth; interesting Metallica will always trump boring Metallica.
